# Development Guide -- Shared Conventions

Shared / cross-repo development conventions.

**Repo-level conventions in the per-repo `DEVELOPMENT.md` take precedence when
they conflict with anything here.**

Some sections will not apply in every repo (Python conventions in a Rust repo,
markdown style in a repo without prose markdown). Skip sections that do not
apply.

## File conventions

### Shebangs

- Executable Python scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` with PEP
  723 inline dependency declarations. uv resolves the deps on each run; nothing
  is installed globally.
- Module-only files (imported, not executed) have no shebang.
- Shell scripts use `#!/bin/sh` or `#!/bin/bash` as appropriate.

### ASCII only

Source files, comments, commit messages, docs, PR bodies, and any other
persistent or externally-consumed content is ASCII only. The only carve-out is
test fixtures simulating non-ASCII input that the code under test must handle.

Common slips to watch for and the ASCII replacements:

- Em / en dashes (`--` instead).
- Curly quotes (straight `'` and `"`).
- Ellipsis (`...` instead).
- Unicode arrows (`->` instead).
- Unicode bullets (`-` or `*` instead).

### Comments

Comments augment the code -- they don't repeat what the code is already doing.
Use them to provide context, explain the why, document non-obvious requirements
or side effects, or flag invariants the type system can't enforce.

- Don't number steps in comments (`# 1. Parse state`). Numbering is unnecessary
  and adding / removing steps requires renumbering.
- Don't reference user-reported bugs ("Regression guard for the user-reported
  bug where ..."). Describe what the code does and the constraint it enforces;
  bug history belongs in the commit message.
- Don't talk about deleted, replaced, or formerly-existing code. Comments
  document the *current* code -- the version a future reader is looking at.
  Phrases like "the wrapper is gone", "this used to live in helpers.py",
  "replaced the per-call-site try / except" make sense to whoever wrote the
  diff but are noise (or actively misleading) to anyone reading the file later.
  If a comment names a symbol or behavior, that thing must exist now. Migration
  history belongs in the commit message that did the migration.

## Python conventions

- PEP 723 inline deps via `uv` -- no global `pip install`. Every script
  declares its own dep set in the script preamble and uv resolves them per run.
- Strive to be consistent in form and layout with other Python code in the
  repo.
- Line wrap at 79 chars.
- ruff and mypy compliant. Repos enforce this differently -- see the per-repo
  Testing section for how.
- Strongly typed. Avoid storing structured data in a `Dict` with `Any` values
  -- use a `TypedDict`, dataclass, or pydantic model instead.
- All tools have well-defined return / exit values. A tool that surfaces
  success vs. failure to a wrapper script must do so via the exit code, not
  just stdout / stderr.
- Catch only specific expected exceptions. Avoid bare `except:` /
  `except Exception:`; when a broad catch is genuinely necessary, include a
  comment explaining why.
- Default to f-strings for dynamic strings and messages, not concatenation.
- Tests use `pytest` by default. If a different framework is more appropriate
  for a particular tool, justify the choice in the commit message.
- Mocks use `autospec=True` so argument verification happens.

## Docker conventions

- Docker Compose files (`compose.yml`, `compose.yaml`, `docker-compose.yml`)
  are linted with [dclint] via `npx dclint .` from the repo root. dclint
  enforces key ordering within services, requires explicit image tags, flags
  missing resource limits, and similar best-practice rules.
- A repo with compose files should pin the convention at the top of each file
  with a `# Keep linted: npx dclint .` header so the tool is discoverable for
  the next reader.
- When dclint flags a rule that is genuinely wrong for a given service,
  suppress it inline with `# dclint disable-line <rule-name>` rather than
  disabling the rule globally. Common case: tracking `latest` for an image
  needs `# dclint disable-line service-image-require-explicit-tag`.
- Resolve dclint warnings by fixing the file, not by widening the ignore list.
  Out-of-order keys, missing limits, and unset `restart` policies are real
  issues, not lint noise.

## Testing

- Add tests for new functionality. A change that adds a feature without a test
  is incomplete.

## Markdown style

GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM). Tables, task lists (`- [ ]`), fenced code
blocks, and strikethrough are all fine.

### Tooling

Two complementary tools enforce markdown style:

- **`mdformat`** is the canonical formatter. Owns every mechanical formatting
  decision: line wrap (79 chars), ordered-list numbering, bullet / emphasis /
  strong markers, blank-line spacing, table alignment. Run via `uvx` with the
  GFM and table plugins:

  ```bash
  uvx --with mdformat-gfm --with mdformat-tables \
      mdformat --wrap=79 --number <path>
  ```

- **`markdownlint`** (typically `markdownlint-cli2`) covers content rules
  `mdformat` can't see: required fence languages (MD040), broken anchor links
  (MD051), reference-link consistency (MD052 / MD053), missing alt text
  (MD045), duplicate headings (MD024), and similar. Config lives in
  `.markdownlint.json` at the repo root. `~/.markdownlint.json` is a reasonable
  starting point when adding markdownlint to a new repo.

The two tools agree on every mechanical rule by design. If they ever disagree,
the formatter wins (it's mechanical) and `.markdownlint.json` gets adjusted to
match.

If the repo has a test suite, add tests that gate both: mdformat compliance
(running `mdformat --check` against the repo's markdown produces no diff) and
markdownlint compliance (no warnings). Without a gating test, both tools are
advisory and drift back in.

### Conventions

- Inline links by default. Use reference-style only when the same URL repeats,
  or when an inline link would force a line well past the wrap limit and can't
  reasonably be reflowed.
- Fence-tag conventions: `text` for plain output, `console` for shell sessions
  with prompts, `bash` / `python` / etc. for actual code. (MD040 requires
  *some* tag; this is which tag.)

### Source-layout gotchas

These aren't markdownlint rules but bite during reflow:

- Reference-style link definitions go at the bottom of the file, not
  interleaved with the list items they're referenced from. Otherwise mdformat
  splits the surrounding list into multiple sub-lists with mismatched bullet
  markers.
- Avoid lines starting with `>` followed by a non-space character (e.g. `>=10`)
  -- a markdown parser treats those as blockquotes, and source reflow can land
  them at line starts.
- Don't put `#<digit>` (issue references like `#1234`) at the start of a
  reflowed line -- they'd be interpreted as malformed ATX headings.

### Prefer lists over tables

In developer-facing markdown, prefer bulleted lists over markdown tables.
Tables are unreadable in plain text: columns wrap on narrow terminals, cells
run together, and headers blend into the body. We read these files in `vim` /
`less` / `git diff` more than in a rendered viewer, so source readability
matters more than rendered prettiness.

User-facing docs that are read primarily in HTML or on GitHub are exempt --
tabular layout works well for configuration / attribute reference sections in
those.

## Mixing user and developer content

When a doc contains both user-facing and developer-facing content, put user
content first. Users don't care about the developer content and shouldn't have
to wade through it; developers will read the whole thing regardless.

## Doc-sync rule

**Documentation is part of the change, not a follow-up.** When code changes,
every doc that describes that code changes in the same commit. No exceptions,
no "I'll do the docs in a follow-up" -- doc and code commit together so
reviewers see both at once.

Before committing a code change, walk through every markdown file the change
could touch and verify it still matches reality. Specifically:

- `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_SHARED.md` -- update when dev-process
  tooling changes (new test conventions, new lint rules, renamed or removed CLI
  flags on a tool, new required steps in the develop / test / commit cycle).
- `DEVELOPMENT_AGENT.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_SHARED_AGENT.md` -- update when
  agent-specific workflow changes (review protocol, file markers, new
  agent-only conventions).
- Per-component / per-tool docs (where a component carries its own README or
  `--help` text) -- update when its CLI surface, options, or behavior changes.

Stale docs waste every reader's time -- users follow steps that no longer work,
devs chase behaviors the code stopped doing. **Every code change is a potential
doc change.** Before finalizing the commit message, grep the repo for any
symbol, flag, convention, or behavior the diff touched and update every doc
that mentions it.

## Commit messages

- Use `- component: Summary of change.` format. Match what's already in
  `git log`; the existing repo style is the source of truth.
- Include a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer for AI-assisted commits.

**Explain the why, not the what.** The diff already shows what changed. The
commit message should give a future reader the context they can't derive from
the diff: the motivating problem, the constraint or invariant the change
satisfies, and any non-obvious tradeoffs or alternatives considered. Aim for a
one-line subject plus one to three short paragraphs. Past three paragraphs and
you're almost certainly over-explaining.

Specifically, do NOT include:

- Lists of every file or call site touched. The diff enumerates them; if the
  scope is "every site of pattern X", say so once. This applies to any prefix
  variant -- `Touched:`, `Files changed:`, `Affected:`, `Sites:`, etc. -- which
  is just the same list with a label.
- Test inputs, fixture values, or the specific bad-shape cases a regression
  test exercises. The test code is the source of truth.
- Sub-decisions that are obvious from the code (which field type was used,
  which helper the code now calls, how a loop is structured).
- Restatements of points already in an earlier paragraph of the same message.
- References to symbols, tests, functions, or files that the same diff
  *removes* or replaces. A subject like "Replaces the per-utility
  `_FooHelper.bar` with a generic base" is a trap: future readers grep for the
  named symbol and find nothing because the same commit deleted it. State the
  new artifact on its own terms; the diff already shows the deletion.
- Pointers to ephemeral scratch -- "the followup notes ...", "the
  tmp/<slug>-... scope", "as discussed in the earlier review", "the plan put X
  in Y". `tmp/` files, code-review threads, and review inputs are working state
  that does not survive in `git log`. If a constraint matters, restate it
  inline; if it's just a paper trail, drop it.
